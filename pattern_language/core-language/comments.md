# Comments

The Pattern Language, just like most other programming languages, supports comments. A comment is a piece of text that is ignored by the evaluator. Comments are useful for documenting your code, and for temporarily disabling code.

### Single line comments

Single line comments start with a double slash (//) and continue to the end of the line.

```cpp
// This is a single line comment
```

### Multi line comments

Multi line comments start with /\* and end with \*/.

```cpp
/* This is
    a multi
    line comment */
```

### Doc comments

Doc comments are used to provide extra documentation for the whole pattern, individual functions or types.

There are multiple ways to write doc comments:

```rust
/*!
    This is a global doc comment.
    It documents the whole pattern and can contain various attributes that can be used by tools to extract information about the pattern.
*/

/**
    This is a local doc comment.
    It documents the function or type that immediately follows it.
*/

/**
    This is a doc comment documenting a function that adds two numbers together
    @param x The first parameter.
    @param y The second parameter.
    @return The sum of the two parameters.
*/
fn add(u32 x, u32 y) {
    return x + y;
};

/// This is a single line local comment. It documents the function or type that immediately follows it.
```
